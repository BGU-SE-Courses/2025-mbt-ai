# Software Quality Engineering - System Testing
This is a repository for the system-testing assignment of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called [PrestaShop](https://demo.prestashop.com/#/en/front).

$$*TODO* Add some general description about the software$$

## Installation
PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application, committed to providing the best shopping cart experience for both merchants and customers. It is written in PHP, is highly customizable, supports all the major payment services, is translated in many languages and localized for many countries, has a fully responsive design (both front and back office), etc.

## What we tested
$$*TODO* Add a description of the module and the user stories that you chose to test.
For example, in the case of the Moodle example, you can write something like this:

We tested the quiz module that allows for creating and taking quizzes. We chose to test the following user stories: 

*User story:* User checks out a product

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a teacher

*Expected outcome:* The quiz is added to the course.

*User story:* Admin changes product price.

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a quiz with two yes/no questions and the quiz grade is calculated automatically and the grade is visible to the students upon submission.

*Expected outcome:* The student receives 100.
$$

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a behavior-driven testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory.
